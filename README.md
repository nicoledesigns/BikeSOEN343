# The Bikers’ Dream – Interactive Bike Sharing Web App
SOEN 343 Project ( Fall 2025 )

**The Bikers’ Dream** is a modern, secure, and interactive bike-sharing web application that delivers **real-time station updates, seamless rentals, transparent billing, and role-based management**.

The application combines a **responsive React frontend**, a **Java Spring Boot backend**, and a **PostgreSQL relational database** to provide a reliable, production-ready experience for riders, operators, and administrators. It simulates a real-world bike-sharing platform similar to BIXI and follows a **layered architecture** (presentation, service, and persistence layers), emphasizing **scalability, data integrity, maintainability, and clean system design**.
